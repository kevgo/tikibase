# Tikibase Rust

![build status](https://github.com/kevgo/tikibase/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Rust re-implementation of Tikibase.

Why:

- higher-level, more concise, more direct, more helpful language
- second implementation of the idea with a better architecture
- fun project, do a deep dive on Rust using a non-trivial codebase
- I felt like I had to fight against Go to make it SIMPLE
- augmenting Go error as they bubble up the call chain has failed at Tikibase
- Go codebase contains a number of issues that take time to fix - why not spend
  this time on a clean rewrite
