# Tikibase Rust

Rust re-implementation of Tikibase.

Why:

- more concise, more direct, more helpful language
- second implementation of the idea with a better architecture
- fun project, explore Rust using a non-trivial codebase
- I felt like I had to fight against Go to make it SIMPLE
- Go error handling has failed at Tikibase
- Go codebase contains a number of issues that take time to fix - why not spend
  this time on a clean rewrite
